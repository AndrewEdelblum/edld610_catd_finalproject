# Introduction

```{r initial_setup, include = FALSE}
# load necessary packages (if you do not have them, you will need to install them first)
library(tidyverse) # for dataframe manipulation and plotting
library(magrittr) # for updating an object that is piped into a function (using `%<>%`)
library(here) # for finding the project folder
library(repurrrsive) # contains the star wars datasets
library(rlist) # for binding all lit elements by column (using `list.cbind`)
library(ggrepel) # for adding geom_text labels that do not overlap

# add gravitational constant (i.e., 6.67408 * 10^-11)
grav_constant <- 6.67408 * (10 ^ -11)

# load bespoke functions from the functions folder
source(here("functions/my_theme.R")) # load my_theme
source(here("functions/geom_saberhilt.R")) # load the function for creating the hilts of lightsabers
source(here("functions/geom_saberblade.R")) # load the function for creating the blades of lightsabers

# set figure output dimensions
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width  = 12, 
                      fig.height = 8)

# how to build this book
# 1. install the `bookdown` packages: install.packages("bookdown")
# 2. Navigate to the RStudio pane that has the environment in it. There should be the following tabs: (1) "Environment", (2) "History", (3) "Connection", (4) "Build", and (5) "Git". Select "Build" and click the button that says "Build Book"
```

## The Data

I would like to use three of the datasets from The Star Wars API (SWAPI): (1) the characters, (2) the planets, and (3) the starships. Fortunately, the `repurrrsive` package contains the Star Wars datasets.
